# Assignment

For this assignment, research cutting-edge technologies in the area of databases, data management, big data, business intelligence, cloud technology, etc. You should assume that you are presenting to the management group at your company, with the intention of having them adopt the technology for one of their products. If you do not currently work for an organization, you may develop a hypothetical situation.

Choose one cutting-edge technology and research it in depth. This technology must be cutting edge and, therefore, should not yet have wide adoption in industry.

## Objective 1: Create a Presentation

Prepare a PowerPoint (or similar technology) presentation, in which you do the following:

1. Identify the new technology and provide a comprehensive discussion of the new technology’s functionality.
2. Discuss the new technology’s advantages and disadvantages.
3. Discuss the evolution of the technology. Contrast its current functionality with the functionality of its predecessors.
4. Evaluate the new technology in terms of the business solutions that it would potentially address.

## Objective 2: Record the presentation

In addition to your presentation, create a brief video in which you summarize your presentation for management. To create a video note, select the Record video option in the assignment submission area. You will need your webcam to complete this video. Press the New Recording button when you are ready to record your video note and the Stop Recording when finished. Click the Add button to include the video in your assignment submission.

- Length: 12-15 slides, not including title and reference slides
- Speaker notes: 150-200 words per slide.

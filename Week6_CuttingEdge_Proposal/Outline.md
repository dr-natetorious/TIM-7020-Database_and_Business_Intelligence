## Section 1: Identify the new technology

1. What is Database Quantum Spremacy
2. How does Quantum Computing Work
3. Grover's Algorithm

## Section 2: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages

1. Implications on data management - acceleration
2. Only exists in mathmatical proofs

## Section 3: Discuss the evolution (compare and contrast)

1. Relational -> NoSql -> For purpose
2. Evolution of NoSQL
3. CPU -> GPU -> QPU

## Section 4: Evaluate the technology for business purposes

1. Quantum == faster matrix computations
2. QaaS brings into the business

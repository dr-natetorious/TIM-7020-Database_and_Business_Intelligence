# Data Lifecycle Management

## Data lifecycle and technology-based opportunities in new Product Service System (2019)

The authors [Zambetti, M; Pinto, R; Pezzotta, G](DataLifeCycle_Technology_based_Opportunties_in_ProductServiceSystems_towards_MultiDimensionalFramework.pdf) state the fourth industrial revolution has led to an enormous amount of data collection and enhancements.  If that data remains as [Dark Data](../BigData) then it will not be operationalized nor monitized.

*Servitization* is [defined](https://www.definitions.net/definition/servitization) as _The delivery of a service component as an added value, when providing products_.  Since the 19th centry manufacturers has combined products and services to increase their product offerings.  It has evolved over time to include many data-driven decisions of which combinations should be placed together.

Making these data-driven decisions requires data collection of _facts_ that lead to enlightenment.  These facts have dimensions:

- Types of data that should be gathered to offer value added service
- data storage options for customer data
- data analysis opportunities
- types of deployment technology for the data-driven service delivery

### What are the phases of lifecycle management

There are different pipelines for _generation versus acquistion_ feeds.

- Generation > Acquisition > Storage Analysis
- Collection > Storage > Analysis > Deployment

When the data is collected from the various sources, it will come in all shapes and sizes.  The system will need to decide if its better to apply _schema on read or write_.

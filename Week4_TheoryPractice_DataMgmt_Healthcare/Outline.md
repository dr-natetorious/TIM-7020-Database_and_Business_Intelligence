## What is the big picture idea

The explosion of data volume, velocity, and variety has led to an increased complexity for data management in many industries.  The health care in particular has been significiantly impacted, yet remains a laggard due to regulation and compliance limitations.

## How has this limited them

The health care industry deals with highly sensitive personal information, and has not been able to modernize their data management strategies.  For instance, most providers are stuck in private data centers and cannot move to the public cloud.

Without access to StaaS, MLaaS, and other SaaS specializations, they:

1. Rely on more operationally complex solutions
2. Lack elasticity and instanteous provisioning of dynamic resources
3. Lack modern security protocols for federated data sharing
4. Difficult to manage heterogeneous IoT systems (vendor lock and limited choice)
5. ??

TLDR: They are large slow moving animals that cannot easily pivot to new innovations nor share costs/information between peers.

## Who is impacted by this limitation

| Role | Pos/Neg | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
|Doctor| Negative| Significiant time performing data entry, less with patients|
|Administrators|Negative|Increased capex and opex, plan for peaks|
|Administrators|Positive|More consistency across network|
|Patients|Negative|Complexity coordinating multiple disjoined views into one dashboard|
|Patients|Positive|More (false) confidence their data is safe|  
|Insurers|Negative|Delays in data sharing and long payment cycle times|
|Partner Networks|Negative| Complex to introduce peer-to-peer records|
|Partner Networks|Positive| Patients vendor lock|
|Researchers|Negative|Limited access to data, slows innovation|

## Theorize why it work this way

- [HIPPA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) and other major laws
- Existing investments in on-premise solutions (and long-term licensing)
- Complexity in data migration perhaps

## Efforts to improve the experience

- Azure Stack and AWS Outpost bring cloud to the data center
- Regulation reform
- Standardized IoT protocols for consistent BI collection
- E-Healthcare movement

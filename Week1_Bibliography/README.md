The growth of data creation from sources such as IoT, Cloud, Big Data, and Mobile (ICBM) is increasing at an exponential pace.  This explosive volume of information is forming in different shapes, with varying degrees of structure.  Traditional database patterns and practices are unable to manage these data sets efficiently, which is driving enterprise environments to invest in new technologies.  Merely adding new widgets to the network topology will not solve the challenges, and existing business processes also need a revision.  Through a combination of these ideas, enterprises can evolve their data pipelines and unlock new insights into more agile data-driven decisions.

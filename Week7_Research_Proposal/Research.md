# How to write Research Proposals

This week, you will create a formal research proposal. Research proposals represent clear and concise summaries of your proposed work, and lay the foundation for any successful research project. One of the primary objectives of a research proposal is to:

1. Describe the research objectives.
2. Identify the specific problem(s) you intend to solve.
3. Articulate the research questions.
4. Discuss how the research will be conducted.
5. Elaborate on what the research will seek to answer.
6. Clarify what the research will not seek to answer.
7. Outline the possible tasks for conducting research.

One way to think about a research proposal is like considering it a requirements document. Without knowing the requirements for a project, the project is doomed to fail. Without knowing the requirements and objectives for a research project, the research project is doomed to fail. When properly written, a good research proposal can guide the vast majority of a research project. A good research proposal will also provide the reader confidence in both your research area and how you plan to conduct your research. One method of having your research proposal evaluated is to ask a friend to review it. Ask them to describe what your primary objectives are, and if they have confidence in your plan.

# Assignment

Research existing theories for databases and data management. Identify common theories, and explain if these theories have evolved over time. Then, research how these technologies are used in practice. You will likely have to include business journals and practical application of the concepts. Choose at least one major theory for further gap analysis. Write an assessment outlining the following:

1. Explain the theory that was chosen.

2. Provide your analysis of the gap between theory and practice (industry literature can help show the state of practice and help you determine the gaps compared with the scholarly literature).

3. Outline the root cause of this gap and include the effect of the gap. Whom or what does it impact? Is it a positive or negative impact? Provide examples to support your findings.

NOTE: Do not select database normalization for your theory.

Support your assessment with a minimum of five scholarly resources. In addition to these specified resources, other appropriate scholarly resources, including seminal articles, may be included.

Length: 5-7 pages, not including title and reference pages

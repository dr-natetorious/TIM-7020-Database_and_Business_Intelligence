# Business Intelligence Excellence: A Company's Journey to Business Intelligence Maturity (2019)

In _Journal of Economics, Finance & Administrative Science. Nov2019, Vol. 24 Issue 48, p345-360. 24p._; [Gonzales, R; Wareham, J](Journey_to_BI_Maturity.pdf) provides a case study on a specific businesses intelligence adoption and evolution.

## Why is BI maturity important

Companies today have all come to realise the importance of providing accurate, relevant and timely information--  information that allows their organisational personnel to engage in effective decision-making practices.

A survey of 1500 CIOs concluded that business intelligence is the highest priority and most crucial element of success, followed by enterprise resource management (ERM) systems.

However, 40-50% of businesses do not roll out BI system effectively and blame poor project management, planning, and failure of the technology to address the business goals.  These failures are despite numerous published roadmaps that provide implementation templates.

## Who is Acme Manufacturing

### Initial SAP ERM Phase

The anonymized case study follows a global food packaging company, that implemented SAP's ERM in 1994 and had numerous challenges such as waste in the value-chain.  They began (1999-2002) rolling out data warehouses, targeting specific geographic locations based on a priority selection.  The rollout took 2x longer than expected and was 300% overbudget.

### Data warehouse v1

The data warehouse was designed to be a large repository of business data based on the premise that if data was collected and stored in one location then the business users would access it for their business needs. This expectation did not occur.  The critical limitation came from performance as nightly replication delayed ETL operations by multiple days.

The middle managment did not have confidence in the system, and were unwilling to invest any time or resources towards improving it.

### Data warehouse v2

In 2005, the company needed a change of direction and rebranded the effort as _Business Warehouse_.  A core requirement was to reduce the complexity and rely on standardized tooling (provided by SAP).  There was also a focus on management reporting, _which incentived business involvement into the technology project_.  They purchased specialized hardware to accelerate the stores and reporting engines (e.g., blade servers).

## How did they eventually become successful

> A major factor of the Business Intelligence initiativeâ€™s success was due to the agreement by senior management as to the role of Business Intelligence [...] that to improve business performance [...] There needed to be the right business processes and people needed to be trained [...] and finally the correct tools in needed to be available to support the people and processes; `Business Performance = Process X People X Tools`.

They also attributed the combination of business KPI with financial information, made the store relevant and full of useful facts.  These fed into a consistent `score card` that was shared across the organization.  The company also hired dedicated personal to oversee the technical and procedural aspects of the corporate analytics.

Over the next four years (2005-9), the employees started to find value in the system and usage grew to 12.5%.  The focus continued to center around the score card, that was kept lean with SLAs (e.g., all reports render within 5 seconds, data shown needed to enable decisions, etc.).

## What value did this deliver

Because the organization had insights into their entire supply chain, inefficienies could be found and removed.  This enabled them to reduce _ordering cycles from 140 to 47 days_ and _customer deliveries from 15 to 5 days_.  With less inventory the company was more agile.

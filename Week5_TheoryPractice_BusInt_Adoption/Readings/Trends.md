# Business Intelligence Technology, Applications, and Trends (2015)

In _International Management Review. 2015, Vol. 11 Issue 2, p47-56._; [Obeidat, M; North, M; Richardson, R; Rattanak, V; North, S](BI_Technology_Applications_and_Trends.pdf) briefly and broadly explores the business intelligence technology, applications and trends while provides a few stimulating and innovate theories and practices. The authors also explore several contemporary studies related to the future of BI and surrounding fields.

## What is competitive intelligence

CI is a subset of BI that focuses on public information to understand business clusters, e.g.,  the energy sector.  It might expand out to include secondary business clusters such as shipping services and refinaries.  Typically these investigations attempt to build a semantic model that represents the larger state.

## What apps use business intelligence

- Mobile Device Faud Detection
- Health Informatics
- Chronic Disease Management

## What are features of business intelligence

- Data Integration
- Real-time analytics
- Balanced efficiency/effectiveness
- Collaboration and Teamwork (e.g., ad-hoc self-service scenarios)

## What are example stores and technologies

- Data Types (structured vs unstructured)
- Data warehousing
- Data mining
- Cloud data services

## What is business analytics

BA is a subset of BI that leverages OLAP systems to perform statistical modeling of a domain.  The three broad research directions addressed in the article are big data analytics, text analytics, and network analytics.

## Why are interactions and interfaces critical

The successful adoption of BI requires that the enterprise finds the interface acceptable and supportable.  If it lacks basic functionality (e.g., visualizations) then the audience will not enjoy the toolste and will avoid it.

Not all systems need to support all common interface aspects.  They provide an example that `Restricted Domain Question and Answer Systems` can be very successful with only a minimal amount of customability.

## What are the big trends, challenges, and issues within BI

- Data exploration and visualization
- Cloud computing leap
- Self-service BI
- Observation Oriented Decision Action (OODA) looping (aka faster iterations leads to faster conclusions)
- Limited number of open source BI platforms

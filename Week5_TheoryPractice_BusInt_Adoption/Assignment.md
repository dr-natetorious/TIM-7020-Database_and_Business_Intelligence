# Section 2: Week 5: Business Intelligence Gaps between Theory and Practice

The [journal article](Readings/Trends.md) listed in this weekâ€™s resources provides a supplemental information that examines current theory and practice of BI.

Conduct additional research on existing theories in business intelligence (BI). What common theories exist? Have the theories evolved over time? Now, research how these theories are used in practice. You will likely have to include business journals and practical application of the concepts. Choose at least one major theory for further gap analysis. Write an assessment outlining the following:

1. Explain why the theory that was chosen.

2. Provide analysis of the gap between theory and practice (industry literature can help show the state of practice and help you determine the gaps compared with the scholarly literature).

3. Outline the root cause of this gap and include the effect of the gap. Whom or what does it impact? Is it a positive or negative impact?

Support your paper with a minimum of five scholarly resources. In addition to these specified resources other appropriate scholarly resources, including seminal articles, may be included.

## Description of topic

There are many types of researchable business problems regarding the topic of data management. Research can help solve any number of known or unknown organizational problems, and data management is no exception. One of more recent issues is how to deal with scalability issues. Storage may be cheap; but large amounts of data can cause other problems, such as performance issues and increasing data access times. There are plenty of researchable topics including data quality, data security, data access, data mining, etc.

Data is frequently an imperative ingredient to any decision-making process in our world. Everything from billion-dollar business acquisitions to what app you download is driven by data. A frequent monumental challenge is determining how to extract meaningful information from large amounts of data. The first step to gathering meaningful information from data is to determine what you are looking for, and how you want to use the data. This may seem obvious, but it is far too often a mistake that many people in business and academia frequently make. Just a few of the high-level business questions that can be addressed through the use of data include:

- When to go to market with a new product.
- If the new product is viable.
- What traits/features the product should have.
- How much of the product you could expect to sell.

In this course, and other courses as NCU, you will learn how to collect, analyze, interpret, and understand data from a wide range of sources, for a wide range of reasons.

# Educational Awareness of Big Data

## Big data analytics the next big learning opportunity (2015)

The authors [Henry, R., & Venkatraman, S.](BigDataAnalytics_TheNext_BigLearning_Opportunity.pdf) discuss the growing trend of educational programs for specializing in Big Data.  They state that it is a many companies are hiring experts and the trend is expected to continue for the next several years.

There have been some challenges with getting these programs off the ground.  For instance, curriculum design has been limited at many institutions, and they have focused on only the basics.  There have also been issues with finding trained instructors and high quality data sets.

It sounds like part of the problem comes from business school's augmenting computer courses that previously focused on Microsoft Excel and Access problems.  Instead there needs to be more collaboration with the computer science schools application of space and computational complexitity concepts.

This combination is not too different from the business world itself, where engineering teams are given the 'how domain' not the 'why understanding' -- the inverse is true for business teams.  Through a combination of cross-collaboration and tooling, it should be possible to reduce the distortion between these disoplines and provide an efficient lens into decision making.

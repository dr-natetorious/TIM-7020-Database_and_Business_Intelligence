# Section 1: Week 3: Current Research

Think about the last decision that you made. This could be the food you ate or the car you purchased. Now think of the data used in this decision-making process. As you’ve been seeing in this course, data drives virtually all decisions being made. Due to its importance, data is a frequent topic in research. New ways are constantly being developed to use, collect, and analyze data. Since data is such an important research topic, numerous venues are devoted to studying and using data.

The primary purpose this week is for you to become acclimated with various venues which focus on the use of data in research. Many of the venues listed below focus on big data, while others focus on how data can be used to assist the software engineering process and understand app tendencies.

- http://2017.msrconf.org – Mining Software Repositories
- http://www.ieeebigdata.org/2017/ - IEEE Big Data Congress
- http://bigdata.stanford.edu - Big Data in Bio Medicine Conference
- http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2017/ - IEEE Big Data
- http://www.sigmod2017.org - ACM SIGMOD- PODS
- http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/ - SIG KDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

While not a formal assignment for the week, you should find a few current venues that are focused on data in a specific area of your interest. This could be data in urban planning, understanding user tendencies for apps, or medical planning. Read at least one or two papers from these venues and gain an understanding of some of the common research areas using data in your chosen area.

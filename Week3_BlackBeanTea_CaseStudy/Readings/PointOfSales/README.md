# Integrating Point-of-Sales Systems

## Impact of POS Data Sharing on Supply Chain Management (2003)

In _Production and Operations Management Vol.12, No. 1, Sprint 2003_, [Croson, R and Donohue, K](Impact_of_PoS_Data_Sharing.pdf) examine the impact of point-of-sales data sharing to improve the efficiency of echelon (tiered) supply chains to "inventory shocks" called the "bullwhip effect."

They state that at a retail outlet, there is `oscillation` in order-flow that tends to be somewhat predicatable.  However, each upstream provider encounters `amplification` that causes their inventory controls to be less efficient.  This is in part due to order lead-times between levels of the SCM.

The authors include a brief discussion of the adoption of electronic POS data, for retailers like Home Depot, and how it enables them to make more informed purchases and take advantage of higher volume purchases.

> Lee et al. (1997) outline the most common causes [of bullwhip effect], including order batching, price fluctuations, supply shortages, and demand signal processing.

The authors found that by providing the POS data, allowed upstream services to reduce the amplification.  They confirmed these results through a simulated Game experiment that improved overall efficiencies upstream.

## Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Demand Forcasting (2011)

In _Journal of Business Logistics, 2011, 32(1): 17-26_, [Williams, B and Waller, M](TopDown_BottomUp_Demand_Forecasting_Shared_PoS_Data.pdf) state that accurate demand forecasting are critical to maintaining customer service levels and minimizing costs.  They use empirically evaluate top-down versus bottom-up forecasting.

### What does TopDown vs BottomUp mean

According to [Maguire, A (2015)](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/forecasting/top-down-vs-bottom-up-which-financial-forecasting-model-works-for-you/) [Cached](TopDown_vs_BottomUp_article.pdf) the key distinction is:

- Top-Down Forecasting: Looks at the overall market size and factor in relevant trends
  - Faster, Reduced Variability, Requires Minimal Data
- Bottom-Up Forecasting: Looks at capacity of individual businesses and performs a summation
  - Accuracy, Item Level Forecasting, More Laborous

### What was their experiment

The authors reviewed breakfast cereal sales data, that incorporated different POS data sharing models, and found that the top-down was easiest to implement but less effective in advertising and promotional scenarios.  This is attributed to the unavailability of the right product at the right location at the right time.  

They also found that larger retailers were willing to share POS data with their suppliers.  Smaller organizations agreed (in prinicpal) that it would beneficial but they lacked the processes to provide these data feeds.  Suppliers therefore have to use a combination of topdown and bottomup, filling the voids with less accurate order-flow approximations.

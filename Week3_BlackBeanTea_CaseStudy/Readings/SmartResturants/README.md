### What additional features do they offer

This effort also builds on [NFC Smart Restaurant](../IoT/NearField_Sensor_Cloud_Smart_Restaurant.pdf) and is by the same authors.  Additional features include NLP of customer feedback, and IoT sensors to detect when events occur such as food is cooked.

A smart scheduling algorithm is also provided to determine items should be started, such as chicken pizza takese 15 minutes and a pasta takes 7. So, (1) start the pizza, (2) wait 8 minutes, and (3) do the pasta.  More interesting aspect is what takes place during those 8 minutes, and how other orders need to weave for maximum parallel processing.

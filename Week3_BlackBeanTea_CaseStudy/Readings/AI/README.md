# Artificial Intelligence and Supply Chain Management

## Where is Supply Chain Software Headed (2019)

In _Modern Materials Handling, January_; [McCrea, B](Where_is_SCM_Software_Headed.pdf) discusses the convergence of AI and supply chain.  This is happening, both in the distribution center and in the software that monitors the end-to-end process.

### How are machines modeling more complex relationship

They state that the volume of data is increasing faster rate, than economically possible to acquire and train employees to review it.  The machines are also more capable of reducing variability and provide more accurate forecasting.

Consider a tractor-trailer traveling the US, that sometimes it takes 1 day other times its 2.  Humans would not be able to handle these fuzzy estimates reliably.  However, machines can review complex relationships, such as the driver can only perform an 11 hour shift and influence of weather.

> "In real-life, everything is a distribution vs. a static number, and yet in the mathematical models, everything from cycle times to transportation times to human production rates to machine production rates are modeled as static numbers," Saxena explains. "In reality it’s a distribution."

## Artificial Intelligence and Supply Chain Management−Applications and Challenges (2019)

In _Proceedings for the Northeast Region Decision Sciences Institute (NEDSI). 2019, p806-838. 33p._; the corporate author [NEDSI](AI_and_SCM_Applications_and_Challenges.pdf) discuss the trends that are occurring across the SCM+AI problem space.

### What barriers to entry exist

Despite a wide agreement that AI can fundamentally alter business processes, and improve the overall success; many businesses are hestient to adopt it.

Stakeholder resistence and employee fear of being replaced, are also commonly cited concerns.  There is also significant costs associated with starting an AI project (talent is expensive).

### Where can AI improve experiences

One major area to receive gains will be the supply chain industry as it could improve forecasting accuracy and decrease the amount of inventory held.  This unlocks capital as discussed in [InventoryManagement](../InventoryManagement) section.

- Streamlining Procurement, when to buy what
- Customer Service (Q/A), e.g., through chatbots
- Supply chain planning around supply/demand coordinating
- Warehouse Management
- Logistics and Shipping
- Supplier Selection and Coordination

### What are qualities of AI

AI systems fall into three categories: `narrow, general, and Super AI`.  Nearly all AI algorithms are narrow, meaning they are built for a specialized purpose.  This increase the cost to procure, and they lack general intelligence, instead focusing on a sole task (e.g., Google Translate).

West and Allen (2018) suggest that three qualities of AI, their capacity to operate in an
intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner makes them useful to industry. First, AI algorithms
are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data, going up and above what passive
machines giving mechanical or predetermined responses can do.

### How to position a business case around AI+SCM

> The promise of AI in SCM is only achievable when organizations plan for, and overcome these
and other challenges discussed in this paper. Organizations can do much to ensure that the promise
of AI is realized, and we offer some guidelines next.

- Make a clear business case with identified expected outcome
- Adopt a gradual approach to AI, not an abrupt shift in direction
- Have a plan for implementing AI, consider starting with Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)
- Determine governance mechanism for data security and compliance
- Augment existing human behavior with AI capabilities to improve efficiency
